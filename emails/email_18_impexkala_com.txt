Subject: PayGlocal Onboarding: Website Updates Needed

Dear VAGHANI TUSHAR DEVRAJBHAI,

Following our initial review for your PayGlocal onboarding, we need your assistance to ensure your website meets our required compliance standards.

Please implement the following updates on https://impexkala.com:

1. As the company has been registered as a proprietorship, RBI guidelines require you to display your legal name on the website. Please update the website to display your registered legal name: VAGHANI TUSHAR DEVRAJBHAI

   Possible locations to display your legal name:
   • Website Footer (Most common)
   • About Us page
   • Contact Us page
   • Site-Wide copyright notice (e.g., "© 2026 VAGHANI TUSHAR DEVRAJBHAI. All rights reserved.")

2. It is required that you add the following policies to your website for legal protection:
   • Terms and Conditions

These updates are necessary before we can activate your account. Once completed, kindly notify us so we can verify and proceed.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this.

Sincerely,
PayGlocal Onboarding Team
